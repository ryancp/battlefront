I wanted to learn Backbonejs for a frontend app and Laravel on the backend to create a RESTful API. This is my repository for a test app. Hopefully it can help others out.

I am using the excellent [Backbone Boilerplate](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate) Project to kickstart the frontend code. So far so good.
